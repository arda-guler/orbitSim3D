; Asteroids! One of the Near Earth asteroids have
; changed course after a deep space collision and
; our civilization was too late to detect the change
; in the object's orbit - we falsely believed that once
; the orbit of an asteroid was known, we could be sure
; that it wouldn't impact our planet in the future few
; decades, by calculating its trajectory into the future.
; 
; Apparently, another object which was small enough to go undetected
; had impacted this asteroid and sent fragments towards our
; direction, in addition to the asteroid's main body itself. Now, we
; have no time to perform a successful asteroid redirect mission,
; the best we can do is to hope for the best.
